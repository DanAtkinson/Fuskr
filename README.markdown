How to use
==========

1. Go ahead and install Fuskr from the Google Chrome extensions gallery.
2. On your desired image, right click and choose 'Fusk'.
3. Choose which direction:
  * '+/-' will return a gallery with images that come before and after it.
  * '+' will return a gallery with images that only come after it.
  * '-' will return a gallery with images that only come before it.
4. Now choose how large you want your gallery to be - 10/20/50/100/200/500 or 'Other' (you choose!).
5. Your gallery will appear in the tab next to your current one. If an image isn't returned (404 or some other error), it will be hidden from view, but you can toggle that too!
